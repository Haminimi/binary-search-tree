# Balanced Binary Search Tree
## Description
A balanced binary search tree with all the basic methods. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees) is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s curriculum. The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Preview
Open up your [developer console](https://haminimi.github.io/binary-search-tree/) to see some of the [binary search tree](https://haminimi.github.io/binary-search-tree/) methods in action.
## Methods
- **insert:** accepts a value to insert
- **delete:** accepts a value to delete
- **find:** accepts a value and returns the node with the given value
- **levelOrder:** accepts a random optional callback function as its parameter, traverses the tree in breadth-first level order and provide each node as an argument to the callback, if no callback is given as an argument it returns an array of values
- **inOrder, preOrder, and postOrder:** functions that also accept a random optional callback as a parameter, they traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order and yield each node to the provided callback, if no callback is given as an argument, they return an array of values
- **height:** accepts a node and returns its height
- **depth:** accepts a node and returns its depth
- **isBalanced:** checks if the tree is balanced
- **rebalance:** rebalances an unbalanced tree
- **prettyPrint:** console.log the tree in a structured format

**To Do:**
- [ ] **Try to improve and optimize the methods**
## Tech
**The project is built with:**
- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Vanilla CSS

**Tools**
- Git
- Visual Studio Code
## Covered Topics
**This section mentions the main topics covered during project work and prior lessons**
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Time and Space Complexity
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Breadth First Search and Depth First Search
- Linked List
- Balanced Binary Search Tree
## Reflection
The levelOrder and height methods are implemented using both the iterative and recursive approaches. For other methods, I have chosen what is in my opinion the better approach for each particular method.

I love to see a tree printed in the console. ðŸ˜„
